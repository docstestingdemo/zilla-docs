  # **encodeImage Function**

High Level

This is a utility function that is part of our Node.js SDK. While it's not directly exported from the `sprite` object, it's an internal function that supports image processing operations within the SDK.

```javascript
function encodeImage(imagePath) {
  const image = fs.readFileSync(imagePath);
  return Buffer.from(image).toString('base64');
}
```

## Why should I use this function?

The `encodeImage` function is useful when you need to convert an image file into a base64 encoded string. This encoding is often necessary when you want to transmit image data over text-based protocols or include image data directly in JSON payloads.

## What parameters are required?

The function takes one parameter:

- `imagePath` (string): The file path to the image you want to encode.

## Prerequisites

To use this function, you need:

1. Node.js installed on your system
2. The `fs` (File System) module, which is a core Node.js module
3. The image file you want to encode should exist at the specified path

## How do I use this function?

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use the `encodeImage` function:

1. Ensure you have the image file you want to encode in your project directory or provide the full path to the image.

2. Call the function with the path to your image:

   ```javascript
   const encodedImage = encodeImage('./path/to/your/image.jpg');
   ```

3. The function will return a base64 encoded string representation of your image.

4. You can then use this encoded string as needed in your application, such as sending it in an API request or storing it in a database.

Note: This function reads the entire file into memory, so be cautious when dealing with very large image files as it might impact your application's performance.
